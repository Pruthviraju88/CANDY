        There’s no outing sweeter than a trip to the candy store. With colorful treats from floor to ceiling, candy stores bring out the kid in every shopper, whether they grew up in the era of penny candy or the latest outrageous confection. These shops also offer something for visitors who are just as sweet on design. From a lablike location of Papabubble in Japan to a lavish old-fashioned shop in France, we’ve found Willy Wonka–esque fantasy worlds across the globe that blend fun with high design. These stores also bring a sense of humor to the shopping experience, with larger-than-life lollipops and candy canes as well as cheeky themes, such as a pharmacy stocked with candy pills (no prescription needed). Whether you're shopping with kids or just satisfying your own sweet tooth, these candy stores are the perfect spot to indulge. Take a tour of these inventive spaces that are sure to give you a sugar rush.
